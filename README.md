# My Bash Libs

I personally use these from time to time for work or non work purposes.  
I abuse GitHub as my backup solution here. But the general public can either use or copy and paste from these files, if any of this is of any use to someone.

## Include in your script

Place the lib file in the same directory as your script resides.

Then include it to your script like this:

```sh
. ./colours.sh
```

## Files

1. [colours.sh](colours.sh) - contains a set of variables to colorize bash output
